# Python > Numbers

Numbers can be either int or float.

Available mathematical operations on Numbers are:  

* `+` (addition)
* `-` (subtraction)
* `*` (multiplication)
* `**` (exponent)
* `/` (division)
* `//` (floor division)
  The / (division) and // (floor division) operators yield the quotient of their arguments.  
  The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type.  
  Division of integers yields a float, while floor division of integers results in an integer;  
  the result is that of mathematical division with the ‘floor’ function applied to the result.
* `%` (modulo)
  The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second.

`dir(math)` gives all the functions available in the `math` module.
